    "In this data analysis & visualization project, I continued to deal with the dataset I wrangled in the previous part, which is WeRateDog Twitter data. [WeRateDogs](http://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. This analysis is based on a master WeRateDogs dataset that has been assessed and cleaned to the best of my ability. \n",
    "I mainly used seaborn and matplotlib modules for my analysis, and it covered one-variable distribution, two-variable correlation etc.\n",

    "From the visualizations, we can clearly see there's a positive correlation between ratings and retweet_count/favorite_count, which is not surprising. And people seem to check out this Twitter account more from their IPhones. And, of course, people are generous about rating those very cute dogs, with 75% of the ratings over 1.0.\n",

    "Certainly there are more to explore with this data. For example, the stage of the dogs clearly has a lot missing. I haven't got a chance to explore the prediction model provided, and there are other useful columns I haven't analyzed yet."
